Language: C++


Author: Ihor Chastkovskyi (chasigor@gmail.com)

Formatted with clang-format :)
Added Makefile and git 

There are 3 solutions:

-plain.cpp      in a single cpp file (make plain)

-classes.cpp    Using classes and separated in files (make classes)

-report.cpp     (make classes)  
                With improvements:

    - Handling different CSV separators. Separator check (fixes segmentation fault )
    - linux-style console parameters and help
    - File customization
    - verbose mode
    - Makefile
    - local Git repository
